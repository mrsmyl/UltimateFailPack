I think this was from when you used to be able to change options in combat, then when you got out of combat the changes would take place.

Use addon_loaded to prepare the conf values as soon as the inital xperl module is loaded.
I think this will work better because the old method was using variables_loaded, the new method insures that as soon as XPerl is loaded, the config will avail since XPerl will always be loaded before the others because it is listed as dependency.

Pet frame was calling event functions too much.

Fix issue with player health frame not updating
-half the events are loaded on VARIABLES_LOADED
-the other half are loaded on PLAYER_ENTERING_WORLD
-Sometimes players would load in, and the event would be missed on the first load in.
