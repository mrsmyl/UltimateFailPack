- Suggestions Tab: Suggestions added for Mists of Pandaria raids.
- Suggestions Tab: Fixed an issue where Cooking and Fishing achievements could "take over" the list, preventing you you from seeing other suggestions once you looked at the tab while the Cooking tradeskill window was open or your fishing pole was equipped.
- Trade module: "The Pandaren Gourmet" is now considered when determining if you need to cook a recipe.
- "Pandarian Angler" (new): Added reminder tooltips for this achievement, expanding the existing option for "The Scavenger," "Outland Angler," and "Northrend Angler."

- Updated for WoW patch 5.1.
- "Pandaren Cuisine" and "Pandaren Delicacies" added to the consumed item tracking system.
- Kill Creature Achievements: Fixed an issue where reminder tooltips weren't working. (This means you, "Glorious!")
- Suggestions Tab, Kill Creature Achievements: When a reminder that you need to kill one of these creatures is triggered, the related achievement will temporarily be added to the suggestions list, as intended.
- Switched to LibBabble-Subzone library for zone/subzone localizations. (Should correct some issues with suggestions, among other things, for users with non-English clients.)

- Tabs module: Improved performance when switching tabs and scrolling through achievement lists.
- Suggestions Tab:
-- Instance difficulty and raid size override options added. Use them to see suggestions that have particular difficulty and/or raid size requirements without having to change your actual instance/group settings.
-- Numerous suggestions added for Mists of Pandaria zones, battlegrounds, and dungeons.
-- Now suggests "Big City Pet Brawlin' - Alliance" and "Big City Pet Brawlin' - Horde" when in an Alliance or Horde capital city, respectively.
-- The "Complete X quests" achievements for Loch Modan and Wetlands were merged into one achievement. Likewise, those for Westfall and Duskwood were merged. Suggestions updated to reflect this.
-- Several Horde-specific achievements were merged into their Alliance-specific counterparts. (For instance, "Hail to the Chef" had a Horde version and an Alliance version with separate IDs. The ID used by Alliance characters is now also used by Horde characters.) Suggestions updated to reflect this.
- Italian localization (itIT) is now supported.
