- Corrected issue where tooltip lines added in WoW 5.x to the achievement UI which normally show when cursor is over an achievement shield ("Earned by", "Not completed by", etc.) were not shown. (These lines will be shown when cursor is over an achievement display, not only the shield portion.)

- Updated for WoW patch 5.0.4.
- Unfortunately, the WoW API no longer supports grabbing item IDs from "Tastes Like Chicken" and "It's Happy Hour Somewhere". Consequently, we cannot automatically detect new consumable items added to the list of those that give credit toward these achievements. Overachiever will instead use whatever list the character had before (saved from using Overachiever previously) or, if that is unavailable, a default list of items based on data collected in a prior version of WoW.
