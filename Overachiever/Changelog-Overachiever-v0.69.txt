- Tabs module: Improved performance when switching tabs and scrolling through achievement lists.
- Suggestions Tab:
-- Instance difficulty and raid size override options added. Use them to see suggestions that have particular difficulty and/or raid size requirements without having to change your actual instance/group settings.
-- Numerous suggestions added for Mists of Pandaria zones, battlegrounds, and dungeons.
-- Now suggests "Big City Pet Brawlin' - Alliance" and "Big City Pet Brawlin' - Horde" when in an Alliance or Horde capital city, respectively.
-- The "Complete X quests" achievements for Loch Modan and Wetlands were merged into one achievement. Likewise, those for Westfall and Duskwood were merged. Suggestions updated to reflect this.
-- Several Horde-specific achievements were merged into their Alliance-specific counterparts. (For instance, "Hail to the Chef" had a Horde version and an Alliance version with separate IDs. The ID used by Alliance characters is now also used by Horde characters.) Suggestions updated to reflect this.
- Italian localization (itIT) is now supported.
