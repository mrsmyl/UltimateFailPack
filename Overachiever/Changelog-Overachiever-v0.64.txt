- Updated for WoW patch 4.2.
- Suggestions Tab: Removed several suggestions that are now Feats of Strength and one that was removed from the game.
- "Check Your Head" and "Shake Your Bunny-Maker": Fixed an issue where some races were associated with the wrong criteria. (Blizzard added goblins and worgen to the criteria and also changed the order.)
- TjOptions library updated to v0.41 to take better advantage of the increased size of the Interface Options UI.
- Small update to options layout and localization (for same reason as above).
