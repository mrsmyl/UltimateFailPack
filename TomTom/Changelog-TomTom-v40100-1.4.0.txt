Tagging v40100-1.4.0


--------------------

James Whitehead II:
	- Possible fix for 21, receiving waypoints
	- Add a /way list command to list waypoints in zone
	This is a simple debug command that may be useful, but is not expected
	to be useful to the average user.
	- Fix handling of floors (fixes 28)
	- Move to AddonCore and add version to About box
	Fixes 22
	- Ensure the waypoint table doesn't get dirty
	- Fix title display when AddMFWaypoint is used
	Fixes 25
