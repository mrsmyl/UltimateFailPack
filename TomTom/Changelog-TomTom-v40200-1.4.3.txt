tagging v40200-1.4.2


--------------------

James Whitehead II:
	- Added an option to hide the 'distance' portion of the waypoint arrow.
	This option is disabled by default.
	- Add an option to use waypoints outside zone to find closest
	It will still restrict the search to the current continent, but will now lead you outside the zone, if that waypoint is closer. This option is disabled by default.
