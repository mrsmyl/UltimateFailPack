Taging v5001-1.0.3


--------------------

James Whitehead II:
	- Update Astrolabe to r155
	This includes the change to remove the clicking noise when in a zone.
	- Add exact coloring (when 98% on target) to feed
	- Add a function to fetch coordinates safely
	For the coordinate feed and coordinate block. this function can be used
	instead of the heavier player position function to get the current
	player's coordinates. This means that depending on the current map zoom,
	the 'coordinates' will display the position on that map, which is what
	we'd expect.
	
	The arrow and rest of the addon continues to function correctly.
	
	This fixes an issue in the deeprun tram and other zones with no
	coordinates.
	- Fix map flipping race condition
