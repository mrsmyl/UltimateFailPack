	- Tandanu via svn r6965: fix loading error when using git-svn (or any svn client that doesn't do svn keyword expansion properly)
	- Omega via svn r6964: yor can be boss 1-4, so account for all possiblities
	- Samira via svn r6963: updated deDE translation
	- Omega via svn r6962: remove more unneeded locals
	- ultrashining via svn r6961: zhTW typo and update
	- ultrashining via svn r6960: zhTW update
	- DiabloHu via svn r6959: zhCN update
	- Snamor via svn r6958: esES update
	- nbluewiz via svn r6957: # Core : auto-whisper (this will be better) # koKR update
	- nbluewiz via svn r6956: # Ultraxion : added Hour of Twilight countdown. (some player suggests). But it can be confusing. only enabled for healer. (healer do not affect by Fading Light) # koKR description update
	- Tandanu via svn r6955: yes, spellIDs can of course still be numbers, sorry.
	- Tandanu via svn r6954: naming conventions: rename ej_spell locals to ejSpell in encounter journal-based localizations
	- Tandanu via svn r6953: fix issue with new encounter journal spell id based localizations
	- Omega via svn r6952: do difficulty auto responses smarter, only grab difficulty on engage, then store it, and used saved difficulty to answer whispers, this should fix a bug where you'd wipe and report wrong difficulty because the old function checked difficulty after you released. the code is also cleaner overall and eliminated an entire function.
	- Omega via svn r6951: update locals, greench mod functional now
	- Omega via svn r6950: the greench does have 2 CiDs, grr
	- Omega via svn r6949: Greench Mod
	- nbluewiz via svn r6948: # Zonozz : also cancel shadow timer when Black Blood.
	- Omega via svn r6947: also, hour of twilight is a 3 second cast on heroic. fixed the cast timer.
	- Omega via svn r6946: change psychic drain CD defaults, this really needs to be on for everyone. i think i watched enough people get hit by this to realize the entire raid needs to be aware of it's CD on heroic when you don't group up behind the boss, you spread out, and have to be aware of his facing and his CD.
	- nbluewiz via svn r6945: #Ultraxion : Added Hour of Twilight cast bar.
	- DiabloHu via svn r6944: zhCN update
	- nbluewiz via svn r6943: # Zonozz : use custom text on Shadow yell. because this yell works on heroic difficulty only.
	- nbluewiz via svn r6942: # Zonozz : remove GazeWarn option. # lots of koKR update.
	- nbluewiz via svn r6941: # Hagara : remove double Watery.
	- nbluewiz via svn r6940: # Core : updated countdown prototype to accept 3sec. (because Ultraxion Fading Light countdown)
	- arta via svn r6939: Make the frame visible might work better :)
	- nbluewiz via svn r6938: # Morchok : re-added crystal check for next stomp. because he do not cast stomps during blood phase :)
	- arta via svn r6937: PvP "invite timer" fix (have to confirm the timer)
	- Omega via svn r6936: Add in some more requests
	- Omega via svn r6935: Make blade dance a CD bar instead of next, since it was strangely changed from 35 seconds exactly on engage all the time to 25-40 random. sigh
	- Omega via svn r6934: Use a real timer for drake event now.
	- Omega via svn r6933: Morchok code improvements, removed uneeded variable, crystalcount is all that's needed if used smart.
	- arta via svn r6932: lua error
	- DiabloHu via svn r6931: zhCN update
	- DiabloHu via svn r6930: zhCN update
	- Omega via svn r6929: Add audio countdown to hagara's specials. enabled audio countdown on ultraxion now that i figured out why it was always wrong, stupid -5 isn't needed in the prototype, it's handled automatically, that's why it was always 5 seconds off, duh
	- nbluewiz via svn r6928: # Madness of Deathwing : impale timer fix.
	- nbluewiz via svn r6927: koKR update
	- Omega via svn r6926: Add audio countdown to hagara's specials. enabled audio countdown on ultraxion now that i figured out why it was always wrong, stupid -5 isn't needed in the prototype, it's handled automatically, that's why it was always 5 seconds off, duh
	- Omega via svn r6925: Ultraxion: Fix a bug with first hour of twilight timer not having a count value. Madness: Try to detect elementium bolts dying a diff way, UNIT_DIED no longer in combat logs :( Zonozz, fix 10 man normal timers after a dark phase. Added heroic 10man Id that was missing.
	- Omega via svn r6924: gaze is simply not detectable, it doesn't fire even a UNIT_CAST event for start, only finish, which is useless by then.
	- nbluewiz via svn r6923: # Yorsahj : remove double difficulty check.
	- Tandanu via svn r6922: fix bad unicode in DBM-PvP
	- Tandanu via svn r6921: Adding more localization files for ptBR.
	Firelands, pvp, Throne of The Four Winds localized to ptBR.
	
	Still missing: Party Cataclysm, World Events.
	- DiabloHu via svn r6920: modify TOC file for DS mod to make the zhCN localization file loaded properly
	- DiabloHu via svn r6919: zhCN update
	- nbluewiz via svn r6918: # Core : added - char to better distinguish boss name and difficulty. # koKR update
	- nbluewiz via svn r6917: # Core : use localization string to auto-whisper. (for non English users)
	- nbluewiz via svn r6916: typo
	- Omega via svn r6915: *Madness: DBM always uses the EARLIEST known CD, not the average, or highest. I have gone through MANY guilds logs for madness, the timer are right, we don't want our timer to be late we want it on time or early. late is just wrong. I spell is cast before timer ends, then it's flat out wrong. I verified in A TON of different guild logs. yes they variate, but not by much, but more come at 100.5 and 130.5 then any other time. sometimes 131 or 131.5 etc. but mostly 130.5, and that's what we use, the earliest, always. *Morchok: i went through tons of logs. mimics are always 5 seconds on 25 man and 6 seconds on 10 man, so that problem is fixed now. They give 10 man guilds more time to move less players around.
	- nbluewiz via svn r6914: # timer changed issue. all changed timer is confirmed for me. # Blackhorn : fix add timer logical error.. needs more review
	- Omega via svn r6913: uncomment hack, only way it's going to get testing is to just throw it at masses and wait for bug reports
	- nbluewiz via svn r6912: #Spine of Deathwing : solved plasma health bar duplicate. now show all heath bar correctly (tested)
	- Omega via svn r6911: Heroic ragnaros was missing empowered sulf spellid for 10 man all this time and no one reported it? sigh. Anyways, fixed.
	Revert some timer changes too. The existing timers were correct and verified through tons of logs. variations must have been lag.
	- nbluewiz via svn r6910: # Spine of Deathwing : fix invaild spellid
	- nbluewiz via svn r6909: # Ultraxion : changed berserk timer to generic. update Hour of Twilight timer. (for heroic)
	- nbluewiz via svn r6908: koKR update
	- nbluewiz via svn r6907: # Morchok : heroic Morchok updates. # Blackhorn : tweak adds timer. added missing Roar spellid. # Spine of Deathwing : added missing spellid. # Madness of Deathwing : combat start hack not worked for me. Check plz. + timer tweak
	- Omega via svn r6906: Add some experimental zonozz stuff
	- Omega via svn r6905: Remove useless stuff from Hagara, comment out special warning for frost tombs, it's kind of pointless to give someone a special warning after they've become frozon.
	- nbluewiz via svn r6904: # Alizabal : fix blade dance warnings. (confirmed all difficulties) + re-activated berserk. she berserks at 5 min.
	- Omega via svn r6903: fix last
	- Omega via svn r6902: fix oozes timer
	- arta via svn r6901: Oozes are on a 1:15 timer instead of 1:30
	- Omega via svn r6900: Zon'Ozz: Perfect the void and psychic drain timers for all difficulties. I was trying hard to figure out why they variated so much, it's because i was expecting the same behavior in multiple difficulties, tearing down the data for each one, the pattern is clear as day. All 3 do in fact have different timings that are consistent. Madness of Deathwing: New pull trigger that doesn't require localisation, as well as some additional icon notes to be messed with later after some rest. Beth'tilac: Restore icons to the EJ entries since they don't have icons, and i hate timers without icons.
	- Omega via svn r6899: zon ozz heroic phase 2 detection fixed for heroic 25 man at least
	- nbluewiz via svn r6898: # Blackhorn : added Disrupting Roar warning and timer. # Madness of Deathwing : adjusted explosion timer. # koKR update
	- tandanu via svn r6897: typo
	- Omega via svn r6896: reduce the near you range for shockwave to 5 yards, down from 12, try to remove the large amount of false positives it had with 12
	- Omega via svn r6895: Spine of Deathwing: Cancel warnings if he levels out on a roll Spine of Deathwing: Added a Barrel Roll cast timer
	- Omega via svn r6894: Blackhorn: actually cancel phase 1 timers in phase 2 on gunship Ragnaros: add blazing heat Add cds to ragnaros with ability to track 2 diff Cds at same time and canceling the right bar when adds die. Zonozz: Cancel the void CD bar if it's cast early (technically if it's cast before CD bar is up then it's wrong anyways but i'll solve that when i figure out why it variates so much)
	- Omega via svn r6893: remove unneeded locals from firelands beth'tilac, it was already using an old EJ hack arta wrote a while back, but that hack didn't work for actual bars, just options. use new one that works for both.
	- Snamor via svn r6892: esES update
	- Samira via svn r6891: added preliminary deDE translation for the Dragon Soul
	- Omega via svn r6890: use a shrapnel ID that actually has a tooltip and icon for options
	- arta via svn r6889: 8min enrage according to Icy-Veins
	- arta via svn r6888: He also berserks in LFR
	- arta via svn r6887: As there is a berserk timer, lets add the option as comment till we verified the berserk-time
	- tandanu via svn r6886: Apply patch for ptBR localization:

	From: Thiago Ribeiro <thiagovfar@gmail.com>
	Date: Thu, 8 Dec 2011 17:09:43 -0300
	Subject: [PATCH] Adding ptBR localization.
	
	Translation of the most important modules of DBM. Translation done
	based on Blizzard's Dungeon Journal, for boss names, spells, and all
	else that is intended to match in-game text.
	
	Missing: Firelands, Cataclysm Party, PvP, World Events, Throne of the
	Four Winds.
	
	Missing: Boss emotes trigger messages (or whatever they are called) --
	will be added as soon as I get them.
	- DiabloHu via svn r6885: zhCN update
	- nbluewiz via svn r6884: one more thing
	- nbluewiz via svn r6883: oops, forgot one file.
	- nbluewiz via svn r6882: # Core : added Encounter Journal id support. It can be reduce lots of localization and can use more correct spell names. Updated Dragon Soul some boss to use Encounter Journal id.
	- tandanu via svn r6881: fix http://www.curse.com/addons/wow/deadly-boss-mods#c3478
	- DiabloHu via svn r6880: zhCN update - 4.3 will be online in mainland China next Tuesday. I will get the localization files fully updated ASAP then.
	- Snamor via svn r6879: esES update
	- Azael via svn r6878: zhtw update
	- nbluewiz via svn r6877: #Madness of Deathwing : fix blast timer
	- nbluewiz via svn r6876: # Hagara : fix logical bug (not tested)
	- nbluewiz via svn r6875: #Spine of Deathwing : apply Seal Armor in lfr25 difficulty cast time.
	- nbluewiz via svn r6874: # DBM-GUI : added range radar, info frame toggle button (for preview and move)
	- nbluewiz via svn r6873: # Core : improved GetBossTarget / GetThreatTraget function (for other realm players). Now GetBossTarget function correctly returns player's server name and class colors. # Alizabal : fix BladeDance warning? (25 man - untested) # Blackhorn : 1. fix Invalid Shockwave target warning. 2. added Twilight Elites spawn timer (experimental) # Hagara : adjusted Ice Wave reach timer (for lfr players)
	- Omega via svn r6872: void is always a lot earlier in LFR apparently, from what i've seen
	- nbluewiz via svn r6871: koKR update
	- Omega via svn r6870: remove phase 4 range finder from heroic ragnaros, it's no longer needed as of 4.3 for any reason.
	- Omega via svn r6869: Switch nefarian mod to true debuff filtering and not raid icon based filtering that used to assume cinders had icons.
	- Omega via svn r6868: text tweaking to fix readability issues
	- Omega via svn r6867: fix typo
	- Omega via svn r6866: More zonozz range frame options
	- Omega via svn r6865: update to Corborus for more accurate emerge/submerge detection using the UNIT_SPELLCAST_SUCCEEDED events for them.
	- Snamor via svn r6864: esES update
	- Omega via svn r6863: oops copy and paste fail, we wanted a SPELL_AURA_REMOVED not 2 SPELL_AURA_APPLIED
	- Omega via svn r6862: Upgrade the range frame for zonozz to do smart debuff filtering, it will now only show people who have shadows if you do not have it yourself (cause you have no reason to avoid anyone without it). If you DO have debuff, it will show everyone (because then you do have a reason to avoid everyone). This should help you much better avoid people that need dispelling when transitioning into phase 2.
	- Omega via svn r6861: shorten first timerPsychicDrainCD cd on engage by a little, same 5-6 second variation on it though, but it does indeed come between 16-23 seconds
	- Omega via svn r6860: also fix some fail ass math in morchok berserk timer, it's 7 min not 6
	- Omega via svn r6859: void of the unmaking is no ln no longer triggering UNIT_SPELLCAST_SUCCEEDED on cast, only on end, so now we have to use yell as a backup trigger for cast. Old trigger is still in place in case it's just a LFR or temporary bug, with anti spam in both, whichever trigger is triggered first is used.
	- Omega via svn r6858: also return difficulty on kill/wipe messages
	- nbluewiz via svn r6857: koKR update
	- Omega via svn r6856: swap some color orders around to match the blizz emotes
	- Omega via svn r6855: Blizz removed the castID for Alizabal, so the trigger no longer exists, do it a different way to restore functionality to mod.
	- Omega via svn r6854: Fix heroic morchok bug with the bar not displaying spellname
	- Snamor via svn r6853: esES update
	- Omega via svn r6852: prep Yorsahj for heroic
	- Omega via svn r6851: fix crystal count on pull
	- arta via svn r6850: fix of the previous fix
	- arta via svn r6849: No need to check for heroic when we check if boss2 exists
	- arta via svn r6848: Crystals are mimiced 6secs later and only the 2nd/3rd crystals are mimiced
	- Omega via svn r6847: zonozz timer tweaks
	- arta via svn r6846: and also for Dragon Soul
	- arta via svn r6845: French fix update
	- arta via svn r6844: French localization (Hope I did add them all correctly (had to convert from ANSI to UTF8))
	- Omega via svn r6843: Fix kill detection on deathwing, localized isn't gonna work either, cuase there are FOUR diff kill yells  (random dragon). But i found a better way. Fix another error with invalid spellid. Disable sapper timer in LFR
	- Omega via svn r6842: shrapnel is destname not sourcename
	- tandanu via svn r6841: add instance difficulty to whisper auto-response; it now looks like "<player> is busy fighting against <difficulty> <bossName> (<hp>, x/y people alive)"
