Tagging as 4.11.4 for Curse


--------------------

subversion:
	- increment version number
	- Omega via svn r7956: now that i raided this fight using a client that actually didn't have nill "boss" unitids, the anti spam was still quite broken on the arc events, it has to be filtered by target, period
	- nbluewiz via svn r7955: # Garajal : added optional spec waring for personal Voodoo Doll. # koKR update.
	- Omega via svn r7954: oh and adjust first protector timer on elegon
	- Omega via svn r7953: Fix some will of empoeror bugs
	- Snamor via svn r7952: esES update
	- ultrashining via svn r7951: zhTW update(Mogushan)
	- nbluewiz via svn r7950: # Core : re-fix Omega's fix. Currently, kill record's missing occur in only field boss. Also kill > pull checking used for correcting bad kill record. So do not remove it.
	- nbluewiz via svn r7949: # Feng : update first Arcane Resonance CD. # koKR update. (heroic trigger)
	- Omega via svn r7948: try to fix a logic problem with stats not recording new boss kills (ie new bosses, old bosses are working +1, but new bosses are always returning 0 kills) Also fix another bug entirely where total kills had a wrong var name for challenge modes
	- DiabloHu via svn r7947: zhCN update
	- nbluewiz via svn r7946: # Update "playerpower" info frame for 5-man instance.
	- Omega via svn r7945: Colorize player bar on an enemy power frame, makes it a little easier to read i guess. might just find a way to force sorting later so player just stays at top or bottom instead of in middle of boss names.
	- Omega via svn r7944: fix stack warning bug
	- Omega via svn r7943: screw it, lets do both.i want info frame to show title as active petrification boss. the power of all 4 bosses, and the petrification level. Hopefully this owrks
	- Omega via svn r7942: actually this will probably be a more useful info frame. it still tells which petrification it is, but now monitors all bosses energy, the petrification level we can get from petrification timer or the alt power bar everyone should have.
	- Omega via svn r7941: also, warn to break em to on cast application too when it's safe as well
	- Omega via svn r7940: add a safety check to break chains special warning so it doesn't tell you to break them when you don't have enough time to
	- nbluewiz via svn r7939: # sorry commit spam, this is final fix for Garajal
	- nbluewiz via svn r7938: # Garajal : Changed all Spiritual Innervation warning to Crossed Over. Also I founded CLEU, removed sync and UNIT_AURA hack.
	- nbluewiz via svn r7937: # Feng : fix timer not canceling.
	- nbluewiz via svn r7936: # Mogushan Vaults Update 1. StoneGuard : - Fix typo. - Changed AntiSpam method. (seems AntiSpam do not prevent spam. this change is unconfirmed.) 2. Feng : - Added count to special timer. - Added Wildfire Infusion stack warn. - Update Null Barrier stuff. This is important to all raid members. - All stuff is confirmed and no error. 3. Garajal : - Change Spiritual Innervation detect method. SPELL_ARUA_APPLIED fires very lately except tanker. - Added Suicide countdown. - All stuff is confirmed. but I not have tank char. tank stuff is not confirmed. # Liu Frameheart : added experimental Jade Fire scanning stuff. (needs more tweak) # koKR update.
	- DiabloHu via svn r7935: zhCN update
	- Omega via svn r7934: #Stoneguard updates 1. Added berserk timer 2. Added Cobalt Mine warnings 3. Improved Amethyst Pool warnings 4. Improved Jasper chain warnings 5. Added infoframe for petrification tracking since color coded alt power bars blizz provide aren't good enough for some (shrug)
	- nbluewiz via svn r7933: # Core: Fix paladin healer check.
	- Omega via svn r7932: null barrier has 25 second cd on LFR
	- ebmor via svn r7931: deDE update
	- ebmor via svn r7930: deDE update
	- Omega via svn r7929: Oh, i found a transcriptor log, it looks like THIS is right event, now it should be 100%
	- Omega via svn r7928: if it's broken comment it out though. i added additional comment, it may not be in right place, but it definitely has to work this way.
	- Omega via svn r7927: revert last. next time you do the boss, pay attention to how it works. THAT drawpower i put the cast timer in, is a channelled cast that literally shows you HOW LONG you have to kill sparks. put boss on focus instead of tunneling sparks and you'll see whwat the point of my commit was, don't go changing it if you don't understand it's purpose. there is a channeled cast that is essencially a "sparks reach" timer. this is NOT a cd timer. i repeat this is NOT a cd timer. each set, the cast gets faster, thus the cast time code.
	- nbluewiz via svn r7926: # Elegon : improve Omega's stuff.
	- Omega via svn r7925: experimental cast time stuff i meant to add before anyways. blue half beat me to the draw power stuff. if this doesn't work, i'll just use code similar to staghelm with a table index and timer values based on number value of stack from said table.
	- Omega via svn r7924: "beware" is already used for aoe explosions and floor vanishing. a 3rd is confusing especially since many strats involve ignoring second protector and blowing it up during first draw power. We absolutely do not want two special warnings that can fire at same time to be the same sound or you can't be as reactive to them, by the sound.
	Draw power special warning should be a standard one. special warnings you can't do anything about (minus maybe throwing a healer cd out for a big aoe use "beware". special warnings that require more individualized actions tend to use the standard pvp flag sound.
	- nbluewiz via svn r7923: # Elegon : Draw Power warn and spec warn.
	- Omega via svn r7922: Why did that still say palace. oh well, fixed
	- Omega via svn r7921: the icon code works now with tandanu's fix, so re-enabling as defaults (as it's more accurate the more that do it. Note, non alpha versions right now ruin the icons, but that's not a bug in current alpha that's just the fact 4.11.3 is making a mess
	- tandanu via svn r7920: update frFR locale
	- tandanu via svn r7919: fix icon removal for voodoo targets
	- tandanu via svn r7918: increment version number for alpha builds
svn:
	- increment version number
subversion:
	- tandanu via svn r7916: change download URL in the update dialog
	- tandanu via svn r7915: * fix global leak * adjust some variable names (naming convention) * remove some stray semicolons
	- ultrashining via svn r7914: zhTW update (Mogushan)
	- Omega via svn r7913: disable combo timer, it's not very helpful
	- Omega via svn r7912: More will of emperor bugfixes. Titan gas timers should work now instead of just starting 1 second timers that didn't help any. Also, always show courage timers, instead of just 10 seconds before it spawns, the other adds i'm content with right now though staying that way.
	- Omega via svn r7911: german pull trigger for Troll
	- DiabloHu via svn r7910: zhCN update
	- Omega via svn r7909: Fix some will of emperor bugs
	- ultrashining via svn r7908: zhTW update (Mogushan/GUI)
	- swix via svn r7907: ruRU update for Mogushan
	- Omega via svn r7906: french update
	- DiabloHu via svn r7905: zhCN update
	- DiabloHu via svn r7904: zhCN update
	- Snamor via svn r7903: esES update
	- nbluewiz via svn r7902: # YanZhu : added Fizzy Bubbles specwarn on cast. # update comments
	- nbluewiz via svn r7901: # Garajal : added berserk timer. # Spirit Kings : added Volley spec warning. # Scholomance Bosses : added target scanning. # Vojak : tweak timer. # Trial of the King : update boss health stuff.
	- ultrashining via svn r7900: zhTW update(party)
	- Omega via svn r7899: while at it, count protectors on elegon too. These are sort of a gauge of performance (ie measuring a phases length by how many you got)
	- Omega via svn r7898: count the specials in the warnings on feng, helps a lot with CD planning.
	- Omega via svn r7897: disable despawn floor timer, it actually despawns instantly on that event now.
	- Omega via svn r7896: it looks like banishment was changed to 65 on normal now too. some attempts to clean icon tweaks
	- Omega via svn r7895: found problem, i should do better job reviewing IT locals that are terrible. it broke all english clients. fixed
	- Omega via svn r7894: Maybe fix feng, it's baffling but for some reason the yell detection is completely failing and it's impossible. the strings match perfectly and events are all right. so lets just add pointless syncing to see if that fixes it.
	- ultrashining via svn r7893: zhTW update
	- tandanu via svn r7892: start timers on combat start for 10-men
	- tandanu via svn r7891: handle boss status requests in the 10-men version properly
	- Omega via svn r7890: comment out novices for now. it seems the overkill trick only detects about 50% of em, some of them go friendly at like 1-2% before they reach that point, preventing any kind of detection. need another method or it probably isn't warn-able :(
	- ebmor via svn r7889: deDE update
	- nbluewiz via svn r7888: # Snowdrift : Changed novice wave start to yells, Added guid check to novice count.
	- Omega via svn r7887: some sha tweaks
	- Omega via svn r7886: maybe this will fix scenario loading problems. something doesn't quite work right when you chain queue
	- nbluewiz via svn r7885: # Snowdrift : unregister short term events when combat starts (if local NoviceDefeat not registered or missing, short term events lasts permanently)
	- nbluewiz via svn r7884: # ShadoPan Monastery Updates. 1. Snowdrift : Added missed event register. + Phase 3 warning. + remove useless locals. 2. Sha of Violence : Sha spike target scanning. 3. Taran Zhu : fix Grapping Hatred spam.
	- DiabloHu via svn r7883: zhCN update
	- Omega via svn r7882: Some party mod updates:
	*Rattlegore tank warning changed to 5 to fit in line with achievement goal (ie, optimal play)
	*Gu Cloudstrike, changed static field back to target scanning (with special warning and yell), it's most definitely scan-able (once we nab right timing)
	*Snowdrift, add some pre fight novice stuff. Also add tank special warning for fists
	- nbluewiz via svn r7881: # Korlof : Flykick seems removed. and update spellid. # koKR update
	- DiabloHu via svn r7880: zhCN update
	- Omega via svn r7879: Add very basic Arena Of Annihilation mod for scenario
	- Omega via svn r7878: Throttle grip message spam on Taran Zhu
	- Omega via svn r7877: Some Jinbak updates/bugfixes
	- DiabloHu via svn r7876: zhCN update. Now local of zhCN is ready for Mists of Pandaria.
	- Omega via svn r7875: further improve durand, since he actually fires first unit died event now, should no longer need hack to do it and just do it this cleaner way.
	- Omega via svn r7874: looks like trial of king does have an english pull local now, so switch it back to that instead of the current one which is iffy, also, fix the group yells while at it since they were changed slightly too Fix kill detection on durand, it does fire a UNIT_DIED event when he dies first time now.
	- Omega via svn r7873: Add IT locals to Mogu Vaults Actually load the ES ones in Mogu Vaults
	- nbluewiz via svn r7872: # Core : Hack for returning unknown unit name and class in cross-realm party. (This occurs especially in Scenario party, bilz function UnitName often returns "Unknown" when GROUP_ROSTER_UPDATE fires, so delays 1.5 sec before get unit info.)
	- nbluewiz via svn r7871: # change Scenario combat start and ends.
	- nbluewiz via svn r7870: # Theramores Fall : remove health frame option. # koKR update.
	- Omega via svn r7869: Don't check IsAddOnLoaded("DBM-Scenario-MoP") until after we load it, duh. Some working logic goes a long way. Also fix kill detection, it's "SAY" not "YELL"
	- ebmor via svn r7868: fix wrong language code (X-DBM-Mod-Name-zhTW)
	- ultrashining via svn r7867: zhTW update
	- ebmor via svn r7866: deDE update (scenario)
	- Omega via svn r7865: lets try a six second delay then, jesus
	- Omega via svn r7864: Remove sub catagories on scenario mod for now. I wasn't sure about other scenarios maybe needing more then 1 sub module or not, but they probably don't either. Nothing that can't all be combined into one.
	- add .pkgmeta
	- nbluewiz via svn r7863: # Fix dupicates in koKR(Anyway, Subcategory in Scenario needed?)
	- nbluewiz via svn r7862: # koKR update (oops, missed locals)
	- nbluewiz via svn r7861: # koKR update.
	- Omega via svn r7860: everything works now that i realize the problem was just that the folder isn't being sent to curse packager yet. add a nil check for now to avoid lua errors if that package doesn't exist/load
	- Omega via svn r7859: Horde data, maybe fix mod starting too early
	- Omega via svn r7858: Fix some theramore problems I think, it SHOULD work completely for alliance and halfway for horde
	- Omega via svn r7857: add two debugs while at it i'll need to test this. If anyone running alpha gets to it first. i still need to figure out why scenario mod doesn't load. i think zone_changed for scenarios fails to get a valid mapid instantly, the teleport is so slow that we may need to delay GetCurrentMapAreaID() itself to fix the problem
	- Omega via svn r7856: commit some non working theramore mods, unfortunately do to 30 min queues followed by 30 min debuffs for leaving (cause all i want to test is load and engage on zonein). i can only try once per hour. so these mods will take several hours just to even get loading right
	- Omega via svn r7855: Also fix english local.
	- Omega via svn r7854: Some handling for scenarios, which return nil for instancetype.
	- ebmor via svn r7853: DBM_CORE_AUTO_ICONS_OPTION_TEXT:format does accept the "ejXXXX" format $spell:ejXXXX is handled in DBM-GUI, PanelPrototype:CreateCheckButton
	But since I don't know the exact motivation for the change in
	rev 7845 I will currently modify deDE only..
	- ebmor via svn r7852: deDE update
	- Snamor via svn r7851: esES update
	- nbluewiz via svn r7850: # koKR update.
	- Omega via svn r7849: increment alpha, so it stops telling me i'm out of date when i'm in raid with someone using 4.11.2 (bad tandanu, you forgot something)
	- Omega via svn r7848: wish there was a better way to do this, but set a 3 min wipe time on anger and salyis
