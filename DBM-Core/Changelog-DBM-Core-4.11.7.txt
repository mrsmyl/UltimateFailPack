Tagging as 4.11.7


--------------------

svn:
	- increment version number
subversion:
	- nbluewiz via svn r8290: # koKR update.
	- nbluewiz via svn r8289: # Will of Emperor : Improve combo warning. If you see combo special warning, detail warning will be shown regardless of your target mobs. Also combo count will be reset regardless of your target. This change also prevent bad combo count. Now combo count will be always correct.
	- Omega via svn r8288: Ah i see now. yeah stun icon/warning fixed. that's what warning was always meant for, so healers can get em free. Completely removed icon code for marking pillars. that seems impossible. no tested fix works so doesn't seem possible to mark them.
	- Omega via svn r8287: That 2 min bug seems unfixable. i'll probably just remove ALL icon features from elegon since neither one works
	- nbluewiz via svn r8286: # Elegon : Added some timer. (And Omega, is that 2 min icons intended?) # Meljarak : Change Reinforcement warning default. And Change some next timer to CD timer.
	- ebmor via svn r8285: deDE update
	- Omega via svn r8284: Change some bars to CD instead of next. also disable some other bars that seem to be completely wrong
	- Omega via svn r8283: small heroic adjustment for protectors
	- Omega via svn r8282: shorten a string in 5 man mods, so more bar text is visible
	- nbluewiz via svn r8281: # Zorlok : Add direction text to Attenuation warning.
	- nbluewiz via svn r8280: # Core : Update wipe check. Now DBM will not wipe during combat (Especially, Player dies Sha of Fear platform.) # Sha of Fear : Initial warning for heroic difficulty. # Will of Emperor : Add fail-safe check for CountOut Combo. # koKR update.
	- Omega via svn r8279: Only register unit power when you are a construct. should save a little cpu. phase 3 is pretty rough on heroic. it's similar to heroic ultraxion on cpu
	- Omega via svn r8278: add more comments to elegon. i'm at a loss as to figure out why it doesn't work but it doesn't. i've tried every possible fix i can think of. the data is clear and correct in log. it should be impossible for it not to work. then again. the icon removal code rarely works on the stun targets either and that should be impossible too.
	- Omega via svn r8277: throttle crush warnings so dbm doesn't freak out when entire raid runs under boss to intentionally wipe it
	- DiabloHu via svn r8276: zhCN update
	- Omega via svn r8275: Fix announcing timers in LFR/LFG. battlegrounds, LFR, and LFG all use INSTANCE_CHAT
	- Omega via svn r8274: add options to the will of emp feature. works well. very useful.
	- Omega via svn r8273: fixed the other events
	- Omega via svn r8272: Some test code, i'll add options for it in a bit
	- nbluewiz via svn r8271: # koKR update.
	- Omega via svn r8270: Fix a bug in lei shi where it always set existing icon to 8 if icon existed, even if it was NOT 8. So if 2 people were setting icons they were still changing erratically.
	- ebmor via svn r8269: Brawlers: Rank triggers localized, rank is not always a digit (e.g. deDE)
	- DiabloHu via svn r8268: zhCN update
	- Omega via svn r8267: more robust fix for working around blizzard staticpopupdialogs taints
	- ultrashining via svn r8266: zhTW update
	- nbluewiz via svn r8265: # Fix broken warnReshapeLife option text. # koKR update.
	- Omega via svn r8264: Wlll power progress updates while a construct.
	- DiabloHu via svn r8263: zhCN update
	- ebmor via svn r8262: deDE update (deDE Brawlers rank detection/trigger is broken, too be fixed later:  enUS: "Rank 1", "Rank 2", ...; deDE: "ersten Ranges", "zweiten Ranges" , ...)
	- Omega via svn r8261: Redo the counting on reshape life since my last fix although worked, broke class colors. i want it to be a count warning with target that has class colors :)
	- Omega via svn r8260: *Fix some option text. *shorten text for amber montrosity explosion cd, because it was too long using full name.
	- Omega via svn r8259: One more tweak for healers
	- Omega via svn r8258: Fix nameplates bugs so they honor settings as well as properly ensure "normal" is NOT turned off when you pull the boss, oops. More anti spam and disabling of warnings not relevant to constructs to make it easier to focus on your construct duties
	- nbluewiz via svn r8257: # Tayak : Fix Arrow. # koKR update.
	- Omega via svn r8256: Reduce special warnings when you are a construct. things that don't concern you. Try to count construct spawns
	- Omega via svn r8255: Remove speed kill and boss health options from brawlers since they do not apply
	- tandanu via svn r8254: ignore oQueue sync messages
	- tandanu via svn r8253: fix brawler fight end detection
	- Omega via svn r8252: Restructure brawlers mod to be a lot cleaner. Bosses will be combined by their rank now. Core options will be split from boss options.
	- Omega via svn r8251: *Breath timer recovery. For the remote chance your timing is so bad that breath was cast within 3 seconds of you gaining fearless, causing it to come off cd after fearless ends but before at least 1 breath was cast. *Remove special warning on breath. it really wasn't that useful. once that goes off you were either in right place or you weren't. nothing you can do about it then though so no need for special warning, just reg warning good enough.
	- ebmor via svn r8250: deDE update (brawlers triggers, preliminary)
	- Omega via svn r8249: add map size for horde brawlers as well
	- ebmor via svn r8248: Brawlers: add missing OG map id
	- Omega via svn r8247: Disable pungency stuff in LFR though. it's irrelevant there. 20 stacks is cap and does pathetic damage. lets not confuse them with information they aren't used to needing.
	- Omega via svn r8246: Fix last
	- Omega via svn r8245: Some timer tweaks on garalon Pungency stack counter (starts at 9, then every 3 stacks)
	- Omega via svn r8244: destabalize is 15sec
	- ebmor via svn r8243: Garalon: LFR berserk (~12 min) added
	- nbluewiz via svn r8242: # Unsok : Cancel Monstrosity's Destabalize bar on Phase 3. # koKR update.
	- Omega via svn r8241: add missing engage yell to brawlers
	- ebmor via svn r8240: deDE update (brawlers triggers still missing...)
	- Omega via svn r8239: Rage timers are good now, only 13 was bad
	- nbluewiz via svn r8238: # Tayak : Fix Unseen Strike CD.
	- ultrashining via svn r8237: zhTW update
	- Omega via svn r8236: Some longer CDs in LFR
	- nbluewiz via svn r8235: # Will of Emperor : Fix logical error.
	- nbluewiz via svn r8234: # Unsok : Fix Destabalize bar not showing. # Garajal : Added some player buff bar. # Stone Guard : Fix lfr Mine CD. # Sha of Fear : Added Fearless buff bar.
	- Omega via svn r8233: try to refix will of emp
	- Omega via svn r8232: fix lua error
	- Omega via svn r8231: popular opinion is that this fight has 2 phases, not 3, and that both advance and retreat are "phase1".
	- DiabloHu via svn r8230: zhCN update
	- nbluewiz via svn r8229: # Tsulong : Fix Terrorize warn. # Sha of Fear : Remove Terror warn. Terror CD not match with Ominous Cackle CD. This special warning very confusing (espcially 25 man).
	- Omega via svn r8228: and i didn't use that api right so do it right this time
	- Omega via svn r8227: make the will of emp combo checker more healer friendly by checking targettarget so a healer healing melee/tank on a specific boss can get combo timing as well. Also add a failsafe check to prevent unit power from firing events off targets other than bosses.
	- DiabloHu via svn r8226: zhCN update
	- Snamor via svn r8225: esES update
	- Omega via svn r8224: Fix a small bug where the emote would come a couple seconds early and result in double scheduling on courages/strengths
	- Omega via svn r8223: revert timer "fix" ultimately i will never be able to fix these myself. i cannot tank a boss doing 10 devestating combos and babysit when rages spawn. hopefully a range dps who is actually attacking them can submit a log or commit a fix to these if they want them to be accurate
	- Omega via svn r8222: try more fixes
	- Omega via svn r8221: also try some rage fixes
	- Omega via svn r8220: that didn't work, try this
	- Omega via svn r8219: fix some fail, hopefully that works
	- Omega via svn r8218: remove npc check from brawlers, i forgot, horde have a diff npc. also, need horde npc yells for english (unless they are the same?)
	- ultrashining via svn r8217: zhTW update(brawler)
	- DiabloHu via svn r8216: zhCN update
	- nbluewiz via svn r8215: # koKR update.
	- Omega via svn r8214: Add a few more strings to brawlers
	- Omega via svn r8213: More boss abilities. This should cover pretty much all of ranks 1-3. More rank 4+ later.
svn:
	- add DBM-Brawlers to .pkgmeta
subversion:
	- Omega via svn r8212: Populate some more bosses Fix a leaked global
	- Omega via svn r8211: Also, fix GUIDs. they need to be 6, 10 now. Example: 67524 (0xF15107C400000CF1)
	- Omega via svn r8210: Fix a bad event name
	- Omega via svn r8209: Initial brawlers guild mod. going to populate it with a lot more npc abilities soon. This just sets up the basic structure
	- ultrashining via svn r8208: zhTW update(MV/Hof)
	- Omega via svn r8207: missed some debug in unsok mod that should have been removed with rest
	- nbluewiz via svn r8206: # Lei Shi : fix typo.
	- nbluewiz via svn r8205: # Lei Shi : Improve icon stuff again. Hopefully this can prevent icon conflict.
	- nbluewiz via svn r8204: # Lei Shi : Icon stuff fix. "raidNmouseover" unit id not exists. Better to adjust update interval for fast update.
	- Omega via svn r8203: elegon icons still don't work, at all. lets try using destGUID instead of source (since they differ for some reason).
	- Omega via svn r8202: Make the icon setting on lei shi faster by using "mouseover" in addition to "target" since it's a lot faster to use "mouseover" Option should be on by default to ensure whoever is fastest computer sets the icon first. If only one person has option on and they have crappy internet/computer, it's that much less reliable.
	- nbluewiz via svn r8201: # Sha of Fear: Change trash CD. # Lei Shi: Icon stuff off by default. It's too slow. Also, on 25 man, guard maximum is 5.
	- Omega via svn r8200: confirmed and uncommented a missing pillage timer. Fixed a bug in the scheduling on pre warnings on shield Fixed a lua error on Unsok
	- nbluewiz via svn r8199: # Tsulong : Revert yell kill detection. 124176 not always fires.
	- nbluewiz via svn r8198: # koKR update.
	- Omega via svn r8197: Make will of emperor combo count reset less likely to fail Add pre warns to shields in addition to the countdowns. Shield of darkness will flat out count it out with warnings to go out with count. If people still hit this shield they deserve to logout and delete their character.
	- Omega via svn r8196: zorlok berserk is still 10 min on normal apparently.
	- Omega via svn r8195: fix a bug that could cuase it to show "activate" on players who yelled during fight.
	- Omega via svn r8194: blizzard intentionally broke target scanning of cobalt mines, so disable it in mod as well
	- Omega via svn r8193: Fix break and pull commands in LFR/LFG
	- nbluewiz via svn r8192: # Meljarak : Change Impaling Spear pre-warning to 10 sec.
	- Omega via svn r8191: alpha revision incriment
	- Omega via svn r8190: although lets assume that doesn't apply to LFR for now
	- Omega via svn r8189: Unsok has a 10 min berserk
	- arta via svn r8188: on heroic10 the shield of Qiang has a longer CD
