Tagging as 4.11.2


--------------------

subversion:
	- increment version number for 4.11.2 release
	- tandanu via svn r7846: insert some arbitrary newlines to distinguish bug reports of actual reports that are just badly written (missing version information) from stupid reports of people who don't know how to update an addon...
	- Omega via svn r7845: apparently that only accepts spellids not EJ entries, so just use call water instead of add name (which is less accurate, but better then localizing it)
	- Omega via svn r7844: Some testing of auto marking adds on wise mari
	- Omega via svn r7843: Improve cinematic options, for one, make original option more specific that it only does it inside instances Second, add a new option that actually does do it outside. MoP speed leveling will appreciate such an option to skip the RP and get right to the instances at 90. :)
	- Omega via svn r7842: Add special warning for standing in shadows of doubt (trash). This is because in a speed run, it's not uncommon to pull them with the sha of doubt. Fix sha of doubt spawn timer.
	- Omega via svn r7841: NOthing actually added, just notes of todo stuff later
	- ultrashining via svn r7840: zhTW update
	- Omega via svn r7839: No berserk timer on LFR Tsulong Added berserk timers for Sha of fear and lei shi (which do berserk in LFR) Fixed Thrash warnings so they don't go off if you're on a side platform
	- nbluewiz via svn r7838: # Core : added boss5 unit id support. (added in MoP) # replace with GetNumSubgroupMembers > 0 to IsInGroup().
	- Omega via svn r7837: Small cpu improvement to GUI frame creation. I can now create it in combat
	- Omega via svn r7836: It locals, untested or verified
	- nbluewiz via svn r7835: # Added 2 more revision keywords. # koKR update.
	- Omega via svn r7834: set missing keywords on 50 other files, looks like when they were merged from branch into trunk they all got erased
	- nbluewiz via svn r7833: # Sha of Fear : added Revision keywords.
	- Omega via svn r7832: Fix invalid thrash spellid so the warnings for it work. Add missing ominous cackle IDs since it actually one of the very few spells that have multiple (ie, it's locational, which means in future when learned, can even have dbm say which platform the cackle is going to). Account for fact in LFR it happens far less often
	- Omega via svn r7831: change plants vs zombie mod to load on npc interaction with Brazie instead of just for entering the zone
	- Omega via svn r7830: set wipe time to 3 min, to account for 2 min rez timers
	- Omega via svn r7829: Add model idea to rabbit
	- Omega via svn r7828: Fix some fail
	- Omega via svn r7827: add a proper set revision flag
	- Omega via svn r7826: oops, lets add a localization too
	- Omega via svn r7825: added darkmoon fair rabbit world boss. Because I can't pass up an opportunity to make a mod that does "HUGE, SHARP TEETH! on me!" yells when you're neck is being eaten through
	- nbluewiz via svn r7824: # Update issue for lua error: Interface\AddOns\DBM-Core\DBT.lua:787: script ran too long. This error seems to related with Limited lua execution time. (http://us.battle.net/wow/en/forum/topic/6019723577). I reviewd code and found some problem. No reason to call GetName() method 2~6 times on single function?. I doubt it and commits this. SO if my change breaks any addon functions, please revert this change.
	- nbluewiz via svn r7823: # Fix unneeded promoted check.
	- Omega via svn r7822: Revert last. Please don't fix bug we do not even have. _ is a bug because blizz leaked it as a global in glyph ui. However, to trigger it, you too, have to leak it (ie do something dumb like _, _, _, something = something instead of local _, _, _, something = something). i've gone over all the code, we do NOT have any leaked _ globals that would taint the glyph UI. furthermore, you put your "fix" in files that don't even use a _ at all.
	There are two glpyh ui taints, one caused by this new bug (which we do not have), and one caused by uidropdown, which has been around since wow 2.0. If you saw dbm taint glyph GUI, it's latter, and that's not fixable. The new taint will explicitly state the reason for taint was tainting _. if it told you reason for taint was calling secure function "SetGlyph()" and didn't mention tainting global execution path _, then you got the other taint.
	- nbluewiz via svn r7821: # Apply prevent taint issue on glyph windows. (Comments: maybe this needed for all local and mod files?)
	- Omega via svn r7820: Add a berserk timer for wind lord
	- tandanu via svn r7819: remove explicit call to :Show() when recycling bars (:ApplyStyle() already takes care of this)
	- tandanu via svn r7818: work-around for a bug in the german WoW localization for Alterac Valley
	- tandanu via svn r7817: another work-around for the timer problem
	- Snamor via svn r7816: esES update
	- nbluewiz via svn r7815: # fix lua error. (I didn't experienced. Reported by other players)
	Message: Interface\AddOns\DBM-Core\DBT.lua:1053: attempt to index field 'obj' (a nil value)
	Time: 09/02/12 17:17:35
	Count: 3
	Stack: Interface\AddOns\DBM-Core\DBT.lua:1053: in function <Interface\AddOns\DBM-Core\DBT.lua:1052>
	- nbluewiz via svn r7814: typo
	- Omega via svn r7813: Some major difficulty bugfixes, mainly to the end combat stuff, where one disconnected mid fight. the end combat stuff was never updated for 5.x and was a mess. also, added in some stuff for the new difficulty 9 index too (40 mans)
	- tandanu via svn r7812: increment ReleaseRevision
