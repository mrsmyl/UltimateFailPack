--------------------

subversion:
	- increment version number to 5.4.1
	- Omega via svn r10320: Fix final garrosh bug
	- alcortes via svn r10319: ES localization update
	- ebmor via svn r10318: deDE update (Galakras)
	- Omega via svn r10317: option default tweak
	- Omega via svn r10316: fix lei shi for 5.4
	- Omega via svn r10315: More garrosh updates for final phase. Also disabled a timer that SHOUld be working but isn't (despite the custom 25, it always starts a 145sec timer)
	- nbluewiz via svn r10314: # koKR update.
	- Omega via svn r10313: Fix a bug
	- Omega via svn r10312: remove duplicate code and make look prettier. Add counting to desecrate weapon. Still need to stop being bad and actually LOG phase 3 later tonight to get the final phase implementation complete instead of wiping to phase 3 repeatedly and realizing you didn't log a single attempt. :\
	- Omega via svn r10311: Add other 2 alliance npcs to Galakras, IEEU doesn't always fire for varian first, sometimes there it fires for jaina or ver and there is a delay on varian that causes delayed pull detection. Probably same problem you saw with horde bluewiz. Probably just need other horde npcs too.
	- ultrashining via svn r10310: zhTW update
	- nbluewiz via svn r10309: # Galakras : Add horde Wave 1 quote (koKR only). TODO: Seems that horde combatstart bugged? (Horde, combat starts after first add reached. Need Review this.) # koKR update.
	- Omega via svn r10308: add timer for the protodrake wave. also, use EJ for adds and reduce locals some
	- ebmor via svn r10307: SoO: Galakras SetUsedIcons; deDE update
	- Omega via svn r10306: Change couple things to count warnings
	- Omega via svn r10305: fix error
	- Omega via svn r10304: fix countdown bug
	- ultrashining via svn r10303: zhTW update
	- nbluewiz via svn r10302: # Core: Remove GetFullNameByShortName function completely. That not needed at all because 5.4 API UnitName() changes.

	- Omega via svn r10300: how did i overlook this, whirling corruption timer added

	- Omega via svn r10298: ru update
	- Omega via svn r10297: remove unneeded global with 5.4
	- Omega via svn r10296: Fix rest of short names too. that function is now useless because it breaks on virtual realm players. when i tested on paragons, GetUnitFullName worked fine so i'll use that for now (but maybe that's not needed at all, untested)
	- Omega via svn r10295: Added some notes.
	- nbluewiz via svn r10294: # Core : fix stupid.
	- nbluewiz via svn r10293: # Core : Remove all StaticPopupDialog to avoid taint problem. # Durumu : Fix life drain target warning.

	- Omega via svn r10277: disable cinematic skipping in SoO because it breaks like hell on the timeless quest chain.
