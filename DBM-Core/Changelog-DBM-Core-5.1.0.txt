	- Omega via svn r8410: shorten timer text for amber Monstrosity again. unfortunately if half of the text is cut off screen it makes ht harder to identify which bar is for Monstrosity. Hopefully this is enough
	- nbluewiz via svn r8409: # koKR update.
	- Edoz via svn r8408: # frFR Update
	- Omega via svn r8407: Forgot to register event
	- Omega via svn r8406: add countdown (off by default) for nightmares.
	- Omega via svn r8405: add time to hide progress. also, call it right away when hide ends instead of waiting until last scheduled hide completes

	- Omega via svn r8398: Fix a rare lua error with debug
	- Omega via svn r8397: Improve the debug so it's less spammy and more importantly can be disabled or enabled on choice On by default because i want people to report the numbers they find. on this or learn from it.

	- ebmor via svn r8395: deDE update
	- Edoz via svn r8394: # frFR Update
	- Omega via svn r8393: Push local updates to make brawlers a little more functional in some languages, at least with end match triggers, as that only requires an npc name which i was able to find some translations online. still could not find others. Also can't fix the match start stuff without proper translations of ranks 1 through 8 for these languages.
	- ultrashining via svn r8392: zhTW update
	- nbluewiz via svn r8391: # Brawlers/General : This will really "fix" berserk timer starting in other zones. # Lei Shi : Rearrange misc option order. # koKR update.

	- Omega via svn r8389: missed a space
	- Omega via svn r8388: add option clarity to spectator mode
	- Omega via svn r8387: fix bad options spellid
	- Omega via svn r8386: that last "fix" to end match and start match broke shit. if you login to brawl pub currentZone returns invalid. so if you don't want berserk timers/warnings leave gropu when you leave zone.
	- Omega via svn r8385: add dark summoner warnings
	- Omega via svn r8384: seed is a CD not a next
	- Edoz via svn r8383: # frFR Update
	- Omega via svn r8382: Range frame improvement. need to see everyone during hide.
	- Omega via svn r8381: Comment out another timer, this one is touchy and in some cases comes very early
	- Omega via svn r8380: with current zone no longer being set, we need to filter syncs when in a group with someone there when we are not.
	- Edoz via svn r8379: # frFR Update
	- ultrashining via svn r8378: zhTW update
	- nbluewiz via svn r8377: # Brawlers/General : Fix zone change timer cancel not works.
	- nbluewiz via svn r8376: # Zorlok : Remove difficulty check. He also always flys to right normal and lfr.
	- Omega via svn r8375: oops, fix a bug with the canceling order
	- Omega via svn r8374: coding style change. same result though.
	- Omega via svn r8373: Maybe fix bad platform detection Add in some possibly wrong timers to go with it
	- Omega via svn r8372: remove unused variable
	- Omega via svn r8371: custom cast time for fire line because the spellid tooltip is wrong.
	- nbluewiz via svn r8370: # koKR update.
	- Omega via svn r8369: Less fail on commenting. sigh.
	- Omega via svn r8368: Thank you priest on my server. I finally have data i needed for the custom berserk timer on Proboskus.
	- Omega via svn r8367: disable static charge timer for now, it's just not right. need more data for it
	- nbluewiz via svn r8366: # koKR update.
	- nbluewiz via svn r8365: # Protectors of Endless : Cleansing Water is CD. not NEXT.
	- Omega via svn r8364: Rank 8 mod completed. Fixed bug in other rank interrupt warnings.
	- Omega via svn r8363: Rank 6 mod stuff. Fix bug in rank 7 mod. Add rain dance cd to rank 5 mod.
	- Omega via svn r8362: Small mod name change to be more fitting
	- Omega via svn r8361: Fix rank 5 bad spellid bug
	- Omega via svn r8360: Add code to cancel bars/warnings for matches that are in progress when we enter zone and do not know current rank.
	- Edoz via svn r8359: # frFR Update, frFR Scenario
	- Edoz via svn r8358: # frFR Update
	- nbluewiz via svn r8357: # Garalon : Fix Pungency timer. # Spirit Kings : Change Next Coalescing Shadows bar. Coalescing Shadows is aoe spell. # Sha of Fear : Add platform leave check if you die on platform.
	- Omega via svn r8356: I'm going to hate the feedback and bitching this is gonna cause. but adding some zorlok timers that are going to be semi accurate but with 10-15 second variations. Lowest seen variation is used but still. annoying. Normal will only have timers for platforms and not phase 2. Because phase 2 timers are impossible without an echo up. IF it's heroic and echo is up, it will attempt to alternate the more consistent timers for that, but cancel all of them if echo is killed.
	- nbluewiz via svn r8355: # typo
	- nbluewiz via svn r8354: # koKR update.
	- Omega via svn r8353: stop all brawlers mods when you leave brawlers area
	- Omega via svn r8352: Fix solarbeam timer
	- Omega via svn r8351: debug and comment cleanup
	- Omega via svn r8350: Misread debug, ignore last. i think current fighter is right. i did need to do some doctoring of combat log for UNIT_DIED events though.
	- Edoz via svn r8349: # frFR Update (PvP, World events, Brawlers)
	- Omega via svn r8348: Looks like npc can still target wrong target on match begin. so no way around it. brawlers guild is one of most poorly designed things blizz ever made for mods. back to requiring over 20 localized chat messages in like 12 languages just to detect a simple damn fight end. leaving all the workarounds as fallbacks so non localized languages have at least a 50% chance to work right for each match instead of 0%.
	- Omega via svn r8347: additional fix. in his "berserk soon" yells he has npc name as his target. so now we just force match his yell target to current fighter and rule out any extra possible targets he yells at.
	- Omega via svn r8346: General Trigger 1 triggers off random spells players near by might cast. my crystal of insanity makes that trigger fire sometimes. it's just not reliable so removed
	On plus, we no longer need to localize end match yells. however, we still have a problem when npc doesn't yell and player doesn't die. Our UNIT_DIED failsafe only works for wipes. :\
	- Omega via svn r8345: This seems to fix it now
	- Omega via svn r8344: commiting what i have so far
	- Omega via svn r8343: more data, if this works, we'll be able to eliminate all match end localized yells and only need the match begin "rank" yells
	- Edoz via svn r8342: # frFR Brawlers update
	- Edoz via svn r8341: # frFR update and add frFR Brawlers
	- Omega via svn r8340: Fix unit died detection for CRZ'd brawlers, improve debug for same
	- Omega via svn r8339: i fail at reverting, i didn't actually revert the teleport code. none the less i want to debug it more to see if it can be filtered just right to use it
	- Omega via svn r8338: add death scanner for "currentFighter" in brawlers guild, this may detect most match wipes with or without yells
	- nbluewiz via svn r8337: # Various timer fix.
	- Omega via svn r8336: maybe fix a bug on battletron, truth is i just have crappy log for him right now, need more data on him tomorrow
	- Omega via svn r8335: Populate rank 5 mod
	- Omega via svn r8334: nevermind, that event fires randomly off all kinds of damn crap. so it's worthless, it seems there is no way around it. localizing is the ONLY damn way to detect match ends, what's more, 1 in 4 fights they don't even fucking announce ANYTHING. good job at failing blizzard.
	- Omega via svn r8333: see problem now, see if this fixes it
	- Omega via svn r8332: add some debug cause something is wrong with this addition, sometimes it's firing before match end?
	- Omega via svn r8331: add some battletron stuff
	- ebmor via svn r8330: deDE update
	- Omega via svn r8329: Remove the redundant regen check. that event will always fire for "player"
	- Omega via svn r8328: Found a way to detect match ends without locals. however, it's not 100% as you need to have a valid guid for the currently fighting player to detect it (it's the teleport out of arena the player casts on themself when they win or wipe). This means you need to be targeting the player specificly, or something else that's targeting the player making targettarget valid. or you actually ARE the player. it's a good backup though in case yell missing.
	- Omega via svn r8327: Turn icons off by default. they still conflict in rare cases (if you set icon same milisecond as someone else, it fails)
	- nbluewiz via svn r8326: # fix wording.
	- nbluewiz via svn r8325: # Lei Shi : Add Get Away Health bar. This is very useful. (tested in lfr and very good works)
	- DiabloHu via svn r8324: zhCN update
	- Omega via svn r8323: couple rank 4 things, more to do later
	- Omega via svn r8322: fix timer fail too
	- Omega via svn r8321: fix lua error in last
	- Omega via svn r8320: add gg engineering rocket warnings to rank 7
	- Omega via svn r8319: Cry of terror does not target melee or concern melee (unless a ranged is somewhere they shouldn't be.
	- tandanu via svn r8318: add frFR localization by Edoz
	- nbluewiz via svn r8317: # Shekzeer : Add heroic Heart of Fear warning. And fix spam in Sticky Resin warning (especially in heroic).
	- nbluewiz via svn r8316: # koKR update.
	- nbluewiz via svn r8315: # Meljarak: Add residue bar. # tweak some options.
	- Omega via svn r8314: fix a bug with missing event
	- Omega via svn r8313: add in a small work around for when brawler npcs don't yell on match end. Mainly for berserk timer/warnings
	- Omega via svn r8312: Fix bad spellid in rank 3 mod
	- Omega via svn r8311: fix loss 8, it can be his OR her.
	- nbluewiz via svn r8310: # koKR update.
	- Omega via svn r8309: add another lost trigger
	- Omega via svn r8308: brawlers berserk timers
	- Omega via svn r8307: Scary fog cd for timing refreshes. Fix get away heroic cast timer
	- Omega via svn r8306: count the specials
	- nbluewiz via svn r8305: # Lei Shi : work CHAT_MSG_TARGETICONS function.
	- nbluewiz via svn r8304: # Lei Shi : Tweak Special timer. # koKR update.
	- Omega via svn r8303: actually this will most certainly fix icons, once i figure out the last coding bits. I'll bug tandanu to make it work tomorrow
	- nbluewiz via svn r8302: # Sha of Fear : Add Death Blossom cast bar. # Lei Shi : Fix special CD after protect. Seems that like Zonozz, if remaining time is less then 5 sec, it will be extend. Also add promote check. Only promoted player can set icons.
	- Omega via svn r8301: Revert last. no. The raid leader may be slow or have out of date mod and then you get no icons.
	i'd rather fix the problem. haven't even tested my latest fix yet. If that fix doesn't work i got another idea i'm sure will work. Just saving as a last resort as it may set the icons a little slower since it'll wait til it has all GUIDs first.
	
	IF the sync doesn't work though, i'm going to sort the GUID in numeric/hex order in a table and apply the icons in that sequence. Similar to garajal/chimereon and similar mods. no possible conflict then. the ideal solution though is the more icon setters the better, but there has to be 0 conflict.
	- nbluewiz via svn r8300: # Lei Shi : Icon function change. Only raid leader can set icons to prevent conflict. # koKR update.
	- Omega via svn r8299: Add timers for lei shi's special abilities Try to fix icons still failing if more than 1 person is setting,
	- Omega via svn r8298: Range frame options for lei shi thing. it worked just fine Hide range frame when on a platform on sha of fear. it covers my spray frame. :p
	- Omega via svn r8297: experiemnt that will probably explode
	- ultrashining via svn r8296: zhTW update
	- Omega via svn r8295: tandanu forgot increment again.
	- Omega via svn r8294: Siege passover
	- Omega via svn r8293: Fix some timers on Flameweaver Koegler
	- Omega via svn r8292: Update Scarlet Cathedral for challenge modes (wish i had known how bad off the timers were there, no one complained about em.)
