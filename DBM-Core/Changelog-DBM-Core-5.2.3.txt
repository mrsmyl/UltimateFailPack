Tagging as 5.2.3


--------------------

subversion:
	- increment version number to 5.2.3
	- Omega via svn r9215: pull useless spam option from primordius, no one in right mind will use that every 5 second special warning. it's a "spread and forget about it" attack.
	- tandanu via svn r9213: typos
	- Omega via svn r9212: Remove version hack, prep for a release
	- Omega via svn r9211: make sure timers cancel in heroic when mounts die in phase 4
	- ultrashining via svn r9210: zhTW update
	- ebmor via svn r9209: deDE update
	- nbluewiz via svn r9208: # koKR update.
	- Omega via svn r9207: *Also, fix viscous horror announce having a green box for an icon
	- Omega via svn r9206: *Fix a bug on Primordius where ooze count on timer was wrong *Fixed a bug on ironqon where scheduling was not canceled and redone on phase changes. *Fixed a bug on ironqon where I didn't account for target swaps done by boss1 casting impale on tanks (he target changes for this too, So you must filter boss1 AND boss2 threat, not just boss2 or just boss1. NOW it's accurate.) *Added nest numbers into jikun, removed redundant () that just made messaging look ugly. looks good now. *Added run away sound to decapitate on lei shen
	- nbluewiz via svn r9205: # ruRU update from tomrus.
	- nbluewiz via svn r9204: # Iron Qon : Fix lua error.
	- Omega via svn r9203: Fix one bug in last and add 2 more nests to 25 normal
	- Omega via svn r9202: *ji-kun, recoded. Nest data for 25n and 25H input. it's not perfect, some holes in 25N. Also, couldn't cleanly implement very specific nest warnings without really overhauling more code or breaking 10 man compatibility so the actual locations don't tell you which one is upper/lower. It's far from perfect, but it'll help verify nest data and code functionality since i will be killing 25H later tonight i can see if locations look ok with this starter code. ***TODO: 1. Code it even better so locations are given to specific detail (ie, saying middle is the upper and SW is the lower for example. instead of saying "upper & lower, one is middle and one is SW) 2. Try to get at least SOME 10 man data. i don't even know if nest guardian data is right so it's commented out 3. Maybe find a way to get nest numbers back in for 25 man. maybe something like "Nest Set 4: Lower SW (6), Upper Middle (7)" ?
	- Omega via svn r9201: RU update from tomrus's branch
	- ebmor via svn r9200: comment typos
	- ebmor via svn r9199: CouncilofElders: dark power timer adjusted (see comments)
	- ultrashining via svn r9198: zhTW update
	- ultrashining via svn r9197: zhTW update
	- ebmor via svn r9196: deDE update
	- ebmor via svn r9195: deDe update
	- Omega via svn r9194: Faded generics good idea, i was planning to add something like that to megaera since blizzard emote too subtle
	- nbluewiz via svn r9193: # Core : Fix worldboss encounter.
	- nbluewiz via svn r9192: # Core : fix lua error.
	- nbluewiz via svn r9191: # Core : Add ends, fades generic warning.
	- nbluewiz via svn r9190: # Core : Remove comment. / Update koKR author. # Jikun : Add Quill count to timer. # Megaera : lfr timer adjust. (WIP)
	- Omega via svn r9189: comment. Put contact info in author section. good for email or google chat.
	- nbluewiz via svn r9188: # update comment.
	- nbluewiz via svn r9187: # Oops, comment not added.
	- nbluewiz via svn r9186: # Core : Fix bug and update comment, please see, Omega.
	- Omega via svn r9185: this also phases out absolute mode. if highest alpha always in charge, we don't need to hack version anymore. after tomorrows release, all problems solved by revision > change
	- Omega via svn r9184: actually i think THIS is best fix. use old method, but prioritize alphas, should fix everything. highest revision (not version) always sets icons, period. if two alphas highest revision, still no conflict, because they should agree on icons used (for example meg mod which had icon changes recently, both latest alphas will have those changes, no issue) elect mode is a disaster, for all reasons i listed. it will just never work unless you sync EVERY icon option in every boss mod on every raid members computer, it will never work
	- nbluewiz via svn r9183: # Fix lua error. Also I finding the way adding zone check.
	- Omega via svn r9182: add some fixme notes to elect mode. it's very broken still (why it was commented out). these two issues need fixing asap or it'll be re-disabled.
	- Omega via svn r9181: ah wait i see why you did that now. no way around a hack then, but no need to set it to super number, will do it this way for now and get tandanu to tag tomorrow
	- nbluewiz via svn r9180: # Lei Shen : Revert Lei Shen changes. This changes not for 10 man. I already know Bouncing Bolt lands at 19.7s, but Bouncing Bolt's aoe effect shows more earlier. Players need to block Bouncing Bolt as aoe effect shown, not lands. Aoe effect shows before 4~5s, so 18 sec warn very very bad. In addition, Intermission timer same with 10 man and 25 man. We simply needed to add heroic Healm of Command bar. (Also, seen by video, http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tFBcqDHxAS4 (at 7:05) sometimes Bouncing Bolt UNIT_SPELLCAST_SUCCEEDED event also fires during intermission. This video shows that Bouncing Bolt warning repeats 2 times. That's why I changed Bouncing Bolt schedule more earlier.)
	- Omega via svn r9179: hack not needed, elect mode uses DBM.Revision not DBM.Version, the highest alpha will always be greatest, so no need to hack latest release version
	- nbluewiz via svn r9178: # Core : Re-enable ElectMaster function. Now if 2 or more user promoted, only 1 user will set icons. Do not compete icon set more. Also this will fix "joshua" not works actually. (Add version hack for 5.2.3 release user to ensure icon changes works. This hack must be removed on 5.2.4 release.) # Durumu : Small adjust to Force of Will bar.
	- Omega via svn r9177: add curse of ultimate doom requests
	- Omega via svn r9176: while at it though, dial them back .5 seconds, cast time seems about 2.5 not 2.0
	- Omega via svn r9175: here i thought it was safe to remove the comments, but day i do someone breaks bouncing bolt on 25 man, so apparently i need to leave them in so people don't fuck up my mods
	- swix via svn r9174: ruRU update
	- nbluewiz via svn r9173: # Lei Shen : Add pre-specwarn for Intermission. (Intermission pre-warning is very important for this encounter)
	- nbluewiz via svn r9172: # Durumu : Reduce beam end timer 1s. # Iron Qon : Fix lua error. / Add 2 active timer. # Lei Shen : Add many active or cast timer. Fix intermission Bouncing Bolt duplicate warning. Adjust Bouncing Bolt timer. Fix first intermission bar canceling bug. # Primordius : Add debuff count stuff. # ToT Trash : Fix 10 man Conductive Shield timer.
	- Omega via svn r9171: Fix major bug on ironqon herioc that caused mod to go all to crap in phase 4 removed unused stuff from primordius
	- Omega via svn r9170: cache some more very frequently used globals
	- Omega via svn r9169: better support for heroic abilities on ironqon's mounts
	- Omega via svn r9168: re-add most of the locations that could be seen in video. Still have some holes. also, i'm at a complete loss how to implement warnings or pre warnings without having 40 elseif rules for each difficulty. not sure the functionality is worth the complete shit on code efficiency
	- Omega via svn r9167: change blue beam message. DO NOT MOVE is flat wrong. if the beam targets a player who happens to be standing near the blue fog, you absolutely MUST move before the beams activate. the fogs spawn seconds before beams emotes, you quickly glance around room to find them, then if blue beam targets you, IF you are standing on the blue fog, you MUST move, otherwise you must not move. "Avoid Moving" alerts better that you should avoid moving if you can, not that you are forbidden from doing so.
	- Omega via svn r9166: data was bad, removed all but the nests i could PERSONALLY verify with my own eyes, and that's nests with a guardian that i went to myself. All other data is going to need personal verification and may take several weeks if necessary to assure it's accurate
	- Omega via svn r9165: add quills count
	- Omega via svn r9164: comment update. should be almost good to go for implement. Hoping for some more locals
	- nbluewiz via svn r9163: # Jinrokh : Fix first Ionization countdown. # Megaera : UNIT_AURA confirmed, good works. Remove sync stuff.
	- nbluewiz via svn r9162: # Core : Prevent wipe on combat. / Increase normal wipe time. / Fix combat log bug. (Re-engaged before 4s) # Durumu : Fix lfr filter. # koKR update.
	- Omega via svn r9161: Forgot to update local to also reflect range 10
	- Omega via svn r9160: Drycode 10 man heroic guardian locations too. Fix 25 man ones not using L. properly
	- ebmor via svn r9159: deDE update
	- Omega via svn r9158: improve 25H nest guardians. need 10 man stuff. If can get the regular nest locations too, should be able to improve upon and announce locations of spawns using same locals.
	- Omega via svn r9157: bump range frame to 10, 8 is a lie
	- Omega via svn r9156: add missing nest guardian to 25H
	- nbluewiz via svn r9155: # Megaera : Some minor changes.
	- Omega via svn r9154: clarify oiption further
	- nbluewiz via svn r9153: # All suggests form tomrus. # Core : Add Only record raid boss encounters option. (for user DBM as replacement of LoggerHead) # Jikun : Remove duplicate code. / Fix 10 man heroic big add warning. # Jinrokh : Fix heroic berserk.
	- nbluewiz via svn r9152: # Megaera : Fix bug in commented area.
	- nbluewiz via svn r9151: # Dark Animus : Add Interrupting Jolt CD. # Lei Shen : Some cast and active timer. # Durumu : Add coloring to Beam warning. # Megaera : Unconfirmed UNIT_AURA stuff (I've seen debuff Torrent of Ice in raid frames, so add this for test purpose.)
	- Omega via svn r9150: fix breath timrs
	- Omega via svn r9149: Redo megaera timers. re-add back head timers (ice and fire are OFF by default for tanks since they are ineligible targets for both). Breath timers are off by default for everyone but tanks and have been consolidated into a single timer AFTER first rampage (still 2 timers on engage because heads don't sync up until first rampage)
	- nbluewiz via svn r9148: # Core : Increase logging end delay. (from tomrus) # Jinrokh : Do aoe pre warn earlier. (from tomrus) # ruRU update from tomrus.
	- nbluewiz via svn r9147: # Durumu : This is final fix for Durumu.
	- nbluewiz via svn r9146: # Durumu : Fix lfr Crimson Fog bug. Add filter to Azure Fog.
	- nbluewiz via svn r9145: # DarkAnimus : Add lfr spell id. # Durumu : Fix lfr Durumu bug. Add lfr Fog stuff. # Jikun : Fix 10 man CD.
	- nbluewiz via svn r9144: # Durumu : Fix lfr durumu and lastBlue variables. I will do another TOT mod fix soon.
	- Omega via svn r9143: alternate icons beams and cinders for when two are up at once
	- Omega via svn r9142: fuck, i just realized that i never commited my damn completed primordius debuff stuff. then i overrided it by updating dbm in curse client. that took a couple hours too, so i'm not doing it again. so just pull it out and leave as is
	- Omega via svn r9141: Remove no longer useful stuff from unsok Spear target scanning for ironqon now that most debugging should be complete. Might need timing tweaks but should work, and more accurately then others (unless i have typos, working on heroic bosses earlier in instance so probably will not test this until sunday)
	- ebmor via svn r9140: Horridon: wrong setIcon target fixed
	- Omega via svn r9139: i could not verify bug that was reported. comment out print for now. i did notice lfr timers are different but i forgot to log it. i was looking for the beam warning bug that never happened. I will log for timer diffs later
	- Omega via svn r9138: move that debug, oops
	- Omega via svn r9137: add warning and special warning for treasure saurok now that i finally got a spawn while logging
	- Omega via svn r9136: Disable some stuff in LFR that isn't relevant there (yes spread mechanics are still there, no, no one uses the range frame what so ever anyways because the damage is too trivial to care)
	- Omega via svn r9135: add count to timer as well
	- Omega via svn r9134: count big oozes on primordius. Many strats involve swapping every N ooze, so make easier to keep track.
	- Omega via svn r9133: some durumu problems, add comments and debug for later
	- Omega via svn r9132: fix elegon lua error
	- nbluewiz via svn r9131: # GUI : More tweak to GUI statistics. (Remove duplicate value loading and positioning.)/ Remove useless localization.
	- nbluewiz via svn r9130: # Iron Qon : Some heroic fix by video.
	- Omega via svn r9129: remove print messages from lei shi
	- Omega via svn r9128: improve the SiS warnings on megaera since neither standing in ice or standing in fire provided any warning (apparently the ice spellid i was using was wrong one, that was ID for not kiting beam and letting it hit you in the face. I'm not sure we need to spam for that anyways considering you'll die near instantly if you don't actually kite beam (and the initial targeting of it does give a warning. Thus, removed the not kiting beam warning and made it a standing in ice patch warning like it was supposed to be in first place)
	- ebmor via svn r9127: deDE update
	- nbluewiz via svn r9126: # GUI : Rename and tweak completed.
	- Omega via svn r9125: this is much better looking. TODO, rename all variables to stuff like row1 row 2 and row 3 and just handle inserting stats after the fact instead of presetting them then hack changing them later. i just don't have patience to make code less shitty tonight at 4:30am
	- Omega via svn r9124: change horridon icon to star, set icons used for it. Skull and X are used very much for marking adds that jump down kill order.
	- nbluewiz via svn r9123: # Durumu : Fix info frame error.
	- nbluewiz via svn r9122: # Core : Improve GUI load in combat. # Horridon : Add set icon on Charge (some heroic guild request). # Megaera : Add count to Rampage special warning too.
	- ultrashining via svn r9121: zhTW update
	- nbluewiz via svn r9120: # GUI : Add lfr25 statistics support in GUI. # Fix several party mod bugs and tweaks. # koKR update.
	- Omega via svn r9119: fix lua error on durumu, still one left to fix. lua error in info frame, commented out for now with lua error. raiding so can't mess with it now
	- Omega via svn r9118: Add some more debuff stuff to Primordius
	- Omega via svn r9117: use triangle for life drain. (skull might be used to mark a kill target like if you have an amber and crimson fog revealed at same time or some other add. Skull should generally be left free on dbm in fights with multiple targets.
	- Omega via svn r9116: Make it so brawlers mods (while loaded) simply unregister events when not in brawlers areas
	- Omega via svn r9115: Warlock scenario: adjust combat start timer by 1 second based on feedback
	- Omega via svn r9114: ##Fix one local bug in GUI ##Set scenario "wipes" text to "Incomplete" text #Removed the heroic disable in scenario mod
	- ultrashining via svn r9113: zhTW update
	- nbluewiz via svn r9112: # Brawlers : Fix error in instance while Brawlers mod loaded. # Jikun : Adjust LFR Quill CD. # koKR update.
	- Omega via svn r9111: ##Support for single format size raid stats (world bosses, world events, pretty much any raid pre wrath) ##Support for challenge mode stats ##Disable stats on Brawlers #An icon clear option for tortos
	- Omega via svn r9110: Small update to warlock mod
	- nbluewiz via svn r9109: # Core: Fix chat msg texture strip.
	- nbluewiz via svn r9108: # Core : Fix class coloring. # ToT Trash : Fix enabled options not works. (TODO: better to disabled option works in core instead of individual mods.)
	- nbluewiz via svn r9107: # Core : Fix separate mod enable options not working. # Jinrokh : Fix water move.
	- nbluewiz via svn r9106: # JiKun : Fix lfr Quills CD. # Megaera : Remove heroic cid register. This causes normal and lfr kill detection bug. # Tortos : Remove duplicate berserk warns.
	- Omega via svn r9105: Update GUI to show scenario stats correctly.
	- Omega via svn r9104: with 5.3 being all about the scenarios, and our scenarios mods going to get some major updating soon?\226?\132?\162, it's important that message text for scenarios be more correct. you don't "down" scenarios for exmaple, you clear them. etc, etc. (note, these aren't in use yet, give time for localizers first)
	- nbluewiz via svn r9103: # oops, missed this.
	- nbluewiz via svn r9102: # Jinrokh : Fix stupid bug for Check water function. / Also change specWarnWaterMove option text more clearly. # ruRU update from tomrus.
	- nbluewiz via svn r9101: # Durumu : Also, change Blue Beam special warning. It's very very very important.
	- Omega via svn r9100: fix duplicate option locals
	- nbluewiz via svn r9099: # Durumu : Small timer adjust. # Add missing option localization for Jinrokh.
	- Omega via svn r9098: hmm, although method's log does not match that either, they must have changed it. remove comment per http://worldoflogs.com/reports/rt-vrm92hjeou9a8l6w/xe/?s=844&e=1400&x=fulltype+%3D+UNIT_DIED+and+targetname+%3D+%22Crimson+Fog%22+or+spell+%3D+%22Ice+Wall%22
	- Omega via svn r9097: added my findings (in comments). Sure your dps isn't just damn consistent?
	- nbluewiz via svn r9096: # Durumu : Revert Ice Wall changes. See comments. / Cancel Life Drain CD. # ruRU update from tomrus.
	- Omega via svn r9095: could have sworn i fixed this once already, who reverted it?
	- Omega via svn r9094: Fix icewall timer (started in two places). only need it in beamended. was going to remove the pull timer for it but you beat me to it :p(does not have combat start timer, first one is after 3rd red died.
	- nbluewiz via svn r9093: # Durumu : Life Drain icons.
	- nbluewiz via svn r9092: # Durumu : Fix Lingering Gaze CD more accurately. Add Life Drain timer and stack Info Frame stuff. Add heroic Ice Wall CD bar.
	- nbluewiz via svn r9091: # ruRU update from tomrus (I do not know Russian at all)
	- nbluewiz via svn r9090: # Core : Change kill message for worldboss. # Elegon : Fix Draw Power specwarn. # Council of Elders : Fix Dark Power CD. dark power cd stuff needs more and more data.. # Durumu : Add some personal warning stuff. # Iron Qon : Fix first Fist Smash. (needs to change timer text?) # Jinrokh : Add water move stuff (like Sha of Fear breath pre waning.). Small Adjust Ionization CD. # Twin Consorts : Add Tears Of The Sun active timer.
