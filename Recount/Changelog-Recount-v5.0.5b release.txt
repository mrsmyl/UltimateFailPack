- Deletion (whether triggered manually or by autodeletes based on zoneing) will now be delayed until the next leaving of combat to avoid blizzard's lovely "script too long" cap.
- Config window is now preloaded on startup so it can be used safely in combat (thanks to blizzard's lovely "script too long" cap.)
- Party/Instance based content collection and deletion should now work for scenarios.

- scenarios seem to return nil on GetInstanceInfo calls. This should band-aid the problem.
