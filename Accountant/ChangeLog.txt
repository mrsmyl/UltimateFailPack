v3.6.00: 2009-09-13
- Updated toc for 3.2 patch
- Add new option to show total on LDB button.
- Added a 'cache box' to 'hide' money from the total. Only the total in
the Accountant frame or Accountant LDB button is affected.
Note: You are allowed to cache more money than you have resulting in a 
negative amount being shown.
- Resized window to show more gold (for those lucky few!)

v3.5.00: 2009-05-02
- Fixed library dependencies that caused a lot of errors.
- Moved options to the Blizzard options for addons.
- Added the option to 'remove' Accountant data for a character. The character could have been deleted.
- Added the option to 'merge' Accountant data of two characters. The character could have been renamed.
- Cleaned up parts of the code.
- Fixed an error when user had selected 'All Chars' tab and used a LDB addon - the tooltip threw an error.
- Made the numbers shown 'stack' better vertically
- Fixed an error where the Accountant title was no showing.

v3.4.02: 2009-01-21
- Added some German translation thanks to ylarion.

v3.4.01: 2008-10-19
- Removed a debug statement that was appearing in chat.

v3.4.00:
- Fixed error popping up when opening Accountant.
- Now allow gold to transfer between characters via mail instead of ignoring

v3.3.01:
- Fixed typo causing the Data Broker icon to not be shown.

v3.3:
- Now has a Lib Data Broker component. If you have a Data Broker display addon
it will display the net profit/loss of the session / day / week / total tabs.
Or the Total of all characters if the 'All Chars' tab is selected.
Note: This has been tested with Titan Panel only.
- The last tab and character(s) selected are now remembered, by character, across logins.
- If you use the Titan Accountant addon, it will display the same value as 
the Data Broker component. This is redundant - the Titan Addon should be removed.
- Net loss (negative) is shown as gold with "()" around it. This is in line with
accounting practice.
- Data Broker button tooltip gives the break down (net) into categories

v3.2:
- Changes to allow Accountant to run in Lich King (Beta)

v3.1:
NOTE: You MUST log into each character you want see in Accountant!
There is new data saved for each character that is needed by the recent changes. 
The current data is NOT lost.
- New look and feel. The older UI was too hard to change and maintain for what I needed.
- Added the ability to choose all Alliance and / or all Horde. 
- Added a character pull down to see a single character. (suggested by Inwe Anwame)

v3.01:
- Removed realm name from all character tab. 
Thanks to LadySilverwolf for letting me know long realm names 
wrap to the next row.

v3.0:
- Fixed the 'repair' account section
- Cleaner code (less global variables)
- Added a couple routines for AccountTitan
- Changed the NiceCash to return 0 gold
- Moved the minimap button slighty off the map


Prior to 3.0:
This was updated at the request of a friend. Accountant appears to be currently unsupported so a new version was required.


(that I can glean from posted versions)
Accountant By Sabaki, Shadow, and Rophy
Accountant Continued by Quel (this was the version I started with)
