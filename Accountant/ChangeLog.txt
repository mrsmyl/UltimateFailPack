the Accountant frame or Accountant LDB button is affected.
Note: You are allowed to cache more money than you have resulting in a 
negative amount being shown.

- Moved options to the Blizzard options for addons.

v3.4.00:
- Fixed error popping up when opening Accountant.
- Now allow gold to transfer between characters via mail instead of ignoring

v3.3.01:
- Fixed typo causing the Data Broker icon to not be shown.

v3.3:
- Now has a Lib Data Broker component. If you have a Data Broker display addon
it will display the net profit/loss of the session / day / week / total tabs.
Or the Total of all characters if the 'All Chars' tab is selected.
Note: This has been tested with Titan Panel only.
- The last tab and character(s) selected are now remembered, by character, across logins.
- If you use the Titan Accountant addon, it will display the same value as 
the Data Broker component. This is redundant - the Titan Addon should be removed.
- Net loss (negative) is shown as gold with "()" around it. This is in line with
accounting practice.
- Data Broker button tooltip gives the break down (net) into categories

v3.2:
- Changes to allow Accountant to run in Lich King (Beta)

NOTE: You MUST log into each character you want see in Accountant!
There is new data saved for each character that is needed by the recent changes.

- Added the ability to choose all Alliance and / or all Horde. 
- Added a character pull down to see a single character. (suggested by Inwe Anwame)

- Removed realm name from all character tab. 
Thanks to LadySilverwolf for letting me know long realm names 
wrap to the next row.

This was updated at the request of a friend. Accountant appears to be currently unsupported so a new version was required.
