* Added PvP and PvE profiles and allow for different settings in each
profile.<br>

going to heal the target for more than the Overheal percentage * 4 as
set in the options using the Overheal Alert slider.<br>

* Changes to the options for overheals and added an Overheal Alert
slider.<br>

* Updated background not to change colour when player stops casting.<br>

* Removed some redundant code<br>

* Spell preference values raised, the preferences are weighted against
the targets DPS and time to live, if the target is about to die and the
preference is for faster casts then healbot will perform a faster cast.
If your target has 0 DPS and more than ~20 secs to live then the
preferences are only slightly considered.<br>

* Reduced score of HoT's when the target is about to die.<br>

* Updated the code for healthstones and healthpots. <br>

<br>

v1.11<br>

=================<br>

* Fix a bug introduced in V1.1 where range checks cause a nil error to
spam in BG's. <br>

<br>

v1.1<br>

=================<br>

* Update spell selection to only choose instant cast spell when the
player is moving.<br>

* Improved range checks to check the range for each spell, some channel
spells only have a 20yards range.<br>

<br>

v1.01<br>

=================<br>

* Fix more bugs with talent modifiers applied to mana cost and cast
time. Healbot is now performing as expected.<br>

<br>

v1.0<br>

=================<br>

* Fixed all data for spells with current patch 1.12 data.<br>

<br>

v1.0
rc2<br>

=================<br>

* 40yard range check does not work in instances. Outside in normal
zones the 40yards check still works. Inside instances there is a choice
of 28yards or 100 yards, to set at 28yards check the option Exact
28yard range check, for 100yards uncheck it.<br>

* Brought back cast time modifier with reduced penalty to scale
depending on users preference as set in the options.<br>

* Moved most register events to fire after addon loads, this is for
faster loading and zone in.<br>

<br>

v1.0rc1<br>

=================<br>

* Added Ranged checking function and tied into existing can cast
checks, currently set to 40yards for all.<br>

<br>

v0.998<br>

=================<br>

* Fixed bug where if you have 5 extra people checked and then select a
6th, it errors with a null value to index local check.<br>

Note: you can now only check 4 people.<br>

* From this release I will start to maintain a change log. Can still
remember major changes in .996 and .997 but the 10 version before .996
are now a blur, it was mostly testing and tuning heals with some other
bug fixes.<br>

<br>

v0.997<br>

=================<br>

* Healbot is now performing better, put back the item bonus and talent
modifiers, these were reduced due to the lesser heals bugs.<br>

* Reduced price of HealthStones, healbot should use these when you mana
is starting to drop and health low, needs more tuning and feedback
welcome.<br>

<br>

v0.996<br>

=================<br>

* Removed cast time from calculating best spell, with the introduction
of item bonuses and talents, the +heals made spells with higher cast
times score badly which resulted in them not being used.<br>

* Removed a number of function calls when not needed, significantly
reduced the amount of code being consistently parsed, this means
healbot is now far more efficient.<br>

* Removed the flashing red background, although this is a good way to
indicate that the heal will overheal and it is best to abort, it annoys
me and I can't be bothered to abort half the time anyway.<br>

<br>

v0.95 - v0.995<br>

=================<br>

* Generally debugging and tuning with the introduction of item bonuses
and talents being applied to amount healed.<br>

* Updated duration and amount healed for priests greater heal spells,
this change in patch 1.10 was not updated in healbot.<br>

* Increased price of HealthPots and HealthStones, to reduce usage of
these items.<br>

<br>

v0.94<br>

=================<br>

* Picked up healbot with some changes from the original, which fixes a
serious bug where the game freezes after a DC but added bugs where
small spells are being selected.<br>

* Making some changes to the code and testing.<br>
