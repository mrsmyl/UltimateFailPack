Tag as 4.5.3


--------------------

Hendrik Leppkes:
	- Add a visibility option for the override bar condition.
	- Improve handling of OverrideBars which are not Vehicles
	- Add a (disabled) option for paging of Dark Apotheosis.
	It does not work however, because the [form] conditional does not fire for it, even though GetShapeshiftForm() returns 2.
	- Don't touch the XP/Rep bar show state, visibility is already controlled with a parent frame.
	- Switch to the correct events.
	- Fix condition order for shadowdance
	- Ensure the lockdown was actually lifted when this event fires.
