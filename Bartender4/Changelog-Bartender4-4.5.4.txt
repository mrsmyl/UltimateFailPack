Hendrik Leppkes:
	- Properly handle fadeout with the SpellFlyout
	- Use the esES locale for esMX, it appears the mexicans don't care to create their own.
	- Enable the "Hide with Override Bar" by default for most bars.
	- Remove all references to the long-gone keyring.
	- Add an option to the petbar to allow showing the button grid.
	- Completely hide empty pet buttons.
	- Some more fixes for hooks and events on disable/enable cycles
	- Remove unused blizzardVehicle checks
	- Properly re-hook after a disable/enable cycle of the VehicleBar
