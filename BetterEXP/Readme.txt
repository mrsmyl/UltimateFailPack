BetterEXP v4.0 Updated/Modified by Ture, Sisters of Elune ready for Cataclysm  by Joelan of Treokkar
Originally by Arronax and Sabar

Features:

 * Top bar broken up into 20 "bubbles" divided just like Blizzard's default
   experience bar for easy communication with non-BetterEXP users.

 * Bottom bar shows your progress through the current "bubble." This allows
   you to easily track your progress at higher levels where each bubble
   represents 10s of thousands or millons of experience points.

 * Calculates your average experience per kill and displays the number of
   estimated kills you have before your next level. (can be reset for when you move to another zone.)

 * Customizable colors for each bar. Your current experience count is one
   color while your rested experience can be a second color so you can
   easily see where your rested experience will end, unlike Blizzard's
   default bar which shows a small, easy to miss icon where your rested
   will end.

 * Resizable to fit any custom UI layout.

 * All /commands easily accessable from a drop down menu by right clicking
   on the bar.
