{{{
  an alternate fix you can try - but will probably come back up if you have DHUD still loaded

  load up your character and open your bags, bank and keyring (doesn't matter if they're offline) and then enter the following into the chat window (one line at a time - copy and paste it)

  /script ARKINV_MainFrame1:SetFrameLevel( 3 )
  /script ARKINV_MainFrame2:SetFrameLevel( 3 )
  /script ARKINV_MainFrame3:SetFrameLevel( 3 )

  logout, log back in

*1.10 (Initial Release)*
  * Requires Ace2 (i didn't embed it)

  * there are no user configurable options as yet
  * items are sorted by empty slots first then by item name in order of stack size
  * unlimited number of bars (there are practical limits though before your screen becomes full)
