	scroll down to ArkInventory
	bind the keys you want to use to specific functions
	
	
Issues:
	* the background can appear in front of the items rendering them unuseable - note this is not an ai code problem, it would appear to be an issue with blizzards CreateFrame api function.  a workaround for this issue is included in the addon config menu.
