What is Broker_XPRate?
======================

Broker_XPRate is a LDB plugin designed for the boring times while grinding out
the levels. It has two display modes, time to level and kills to level. Both
modes take into account the amount of restXP you have if any.

**Credit to Laughlorien and KillMeterFu for some of the per kill code**
