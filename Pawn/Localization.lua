Each item will get one score for each “scale” that is active for your character.  A scale lists the stats that are important to you, and how many points each stat is worth.  You usually have one scale for each of your class's specs or roles.  The scores are normally hidden, but you can see how an item's score was calculated on the Compare tab.

 • You can turn a scale on or off by shift-clicking it in the list on the Scale tab.


Pawn comes with scales from Wowhead for each class and spec.  You can also create your own by assigning point values to each stat, import scales from the internet or simulation tools, or share scales with guildmates.
