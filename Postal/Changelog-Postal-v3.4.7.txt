BlackBook will now also record the faction and realm of players you have recently mailed, and only show/use/autocomplete the ones from the same realm/faction as you. This is so that you can use the same profile across multiple servers/factions. The recently mailed list is increased in size from 10 to 20 and the list is wiped with this update.

CheckInbox() behavior changed slightly. It now fires MAIL_INBOX_UPDATE immediately (synchronous) if called within 60 seconds of the last inbox update, but doesn't do it immediately otherwise (asynchronous). Change code in OpenAll module to take this into account to speed up continuing OpenAll by not waiting an extra 10 seconds while doing mailbox refreshes.
